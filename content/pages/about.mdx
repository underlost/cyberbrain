#### What is cyberbrain?

cyberbrain is a development lab that builds innovative apps for writing.

#### What is this for?

Right now, this is a set of experiments for writing and publishing with the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) content management system. Right now for most users it isnt useful.

I'm currently developing it as a means for short form writing and posting ideas to my personal blog. However, as I'm discovering shortcomings with Ghost or features I want to personally see added but are not yet capable with the Ghost Project, I am developing cyberbrain to fill in those places.

The first major function is to allow custom fields on Ghost posts with Gatsby, by creating a secondary API that ties external content via the cyberbrain API to content published on Ghost.

If none of that makes sense, this service and site probably isnt for you. Sorry about that. ðŸ˜…
